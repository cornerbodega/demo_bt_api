\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}

My name is Marvin Rhone, and I am part of a team currently developing software to simplify the compliance process for I-502 producers and processors. I am writing because I would like to learn more about your seed-to-sale traceability process.

We understand compliance has been a pain for many business owners, and growers from all over the state have shared with us their aspirations for a better traceability system. Over the past eighteen months, we have been developing just such a system: a tailor-made solution for compliance with WAC 314-55. 

This new system is designed to handle traceability tasks such as harvesting plants and sending manifests in as few clicks as possible via an easy-to-use, intuitive user interface. It works on any device without the need to import any data, download any software, or buy any hardware. 

Feedback from local growers such as yourself has refined our product and defines our service. I would very much like for you to be a part of our growing community. Please get in touch to learn more and for a free demo.



Thank you for your time and consideration.

I look forward to your reply.

\closing{Warm Regards,}
