            Stimulating a problem discussion:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>We think these are the top five problems facing the industry. How would you rank them as they affect your company? </li>
            <li>If you have three major problems to solve (in this area) in the year ahear, what are they and why do they make the "top three"?</li>
            <li>How does your company evaluate new products? (price? performance? features?)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="">
            Summarize this discussion by asking two questions:
            <ol>
                <li>What's the biggest pain in how you work?</li>
                <li>If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about what you do, what would it be?</li>
                <li>    Casually ask, "How much does this problem cost you (in terms of lost revenue, lost customers, lost time, frustration, etc.)?"</li>
            </ol>

            <pnlp />

            <div class="">
                Finally, introduce the company's solution (not a set of features, but only the big idea)
            </div>
            <pnlp />

            <div class="">
                Pause and wait to gague their reaction.
                Do they even understand what the words mean?
                Is the solution evident enough that they say, "if you could do that, all my problems would be solved?"
                Alternatively, do they say, "What do you mean?" Then do you have to explain it for 20 minutes and they still don't understand?
                Ask how your solution compares with current solutions you just discussed.

                Once again, the point is not to deliver a sales pitch, but to get their reaction and a healthy discussion.
            </div>
            <pnlp />

            <div class="">
                Of course, what you learn from these discussions depends on what sticks after the meeting. Responses tend to blur together, so it's helpful to take
                hypothesis briefs along on the visits. Look at the entire set. Before each call, shorten the list to "What are the three most important things I need to learn from the call?"
                Get at least those covered.
                Take notes and listen actively. Over time, as response to key issues crystalizes, begin to ask different questions.

            <div class="">
                Think about ending a meeting with "Who are the three other smart people like you I should talk to?" I want my contact list to always be getting bigger. Or "What is it that I should have asked you?"
